			<h2>About This App</h2>
			<p><strong>Author:</strong> Connor Guerin</p>
			<h3>Key Bindings:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>W - Move up</li>
					<li>S - Move down</li>
					<li>A - Move left</li>
					<li>D - Move right</li>
					<li>SPACE - Select item</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For a 3 key setup: A, D, and SPACE can be used to navigate.</p>

			<h3>Test Conditions</h3>
			<p>The calcuator was tested by inputting a sequence of 5 operations (separated by a C button press) using a 5 key setup and a 3 key setup as described above. A stopwatch was used to time the input using both setups</p>
			<p>
			The test sequences were:<br>
			54 * 6 = / 3 = C<br>
			881 / 5 = * 3 = C<br>
			20 - 9 + 6 = + 1 = C<br>
			2 + 3 + 4 = C<br>
			43278 / 34 = * 45472527 = + 5 = C<br>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Findings</h3>
			<p>Overall, it took significantly more time to complete the operations using 3 buttons than with 5 buttons. In testing, 5 buttons took about 30 seconds, while 3 buttons took closer to 45 seconds. I found that there was no noticable difference in the amount of errors when using either method.</p>
			<p>One interesting obervation was that when using the 3 button setup I tended to limit myself to using 2 buttons (only D and SPACE), even when the target buttons were closer via the A key. It was interesting that using two buttons to navigate felt more natural then making more use of all 3 buttons. When I tried to force myself to use the A key when the target was closer, I found that often times it felt as if it was taking more time to navigate than if I had simply used the D key to traverse more buttons to get to the target.</p>
